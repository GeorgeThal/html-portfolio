<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 17-year-old born on October 19th. I've been into video games ever since I was born,<br />
 and I play them every day. I also enjoy working out and being active, always seeking new<br />
 experiences and ways to have fun. Currently, I'm in my third year of high school, and I<br />
 aspire to study and work on the Back-end field. I'm excited about the opportunities that<br />
 the future holds and can't wait to see where my passion for technology will take me.</p>
